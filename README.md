# DRINKLAND
App that allows you to save recipes for drinks, search for them and check the details (ingredients).
This is my first app made in React and in that I learn how to use hooks, functional components, routing (@reach/router). I also learn how to use axios and how to connect React frontend and Express backend.

## Tech stack: 
MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

## Usage:
You need to have to JavaScript package manager npm from Node.js. You need to install JS dependencies:
```
npm install --save
```
Then you can run project by a command:
```
npm run dev
```
OR
```
npm run start
```
